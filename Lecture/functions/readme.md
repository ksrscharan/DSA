# Functions
## What are functions?
- Takes an input, and gives output.
- _example:_ 
    > f (x) = x + 4
- Whenever you have set of instructions to be performed on a certain input, then you can go for or create function out of it.
## Why Functions?
- Reduces code redundancy.
- Logic with variable input.
- Readable, organized.
- Any logic can be separated into functions.

## Function Declaration
```
returnType functionName (inputToFunction){
   //body or logic
   return xxx
}
```
## Things to remember
- Return keyword returns the value at the place where function was called
- If a function doesn't have to return anything, then, the return type is void.
- Whenever you run a java file, by default, main function is called.
- Everyting returns to main function body.
- A function cannot return twice.
- A function can be called as many times.
- No code runs after return statement.
